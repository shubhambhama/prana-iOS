  - **Insight Summaries**: Smart summaries based on the user's breathing activities to promote self-awareness and mental well-being.

- **Planning & Flexibility**: Users can plan sessions ahead or start/stop them at any time based on their convenience.

- **Support Page**:
  - Overview of the app’s purpose and benefits.
  - Developer’s social links for quick connection and feedback.

## Project Details

The app is built with modern iOS development tools and focuses on user accessibility and ease of use:

- **SwiftUI**: Used for building intuitive and responsive UIs.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates business logic from UI for better scalability and maintenance.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated to deliver personalized content and breathing insights.
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhances the experience, especially useful for older users who benefit from calm visual feedback.

## Learning Curve

During the development of this project, the following areas were explored and implemented:

1. **Breathing Animation Design**: Carefully crafted animations for each breathing method to visually guide the user.
2. **Mood-Based Personalization**: Mapping emotional states to specific breathing patterns.
3. **API Integration**: Working with OpenAI’s API to fetch dynamic, daily content.
4. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensured the interface is easy to navigate for senior users.
